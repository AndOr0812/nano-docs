## Protocol Design vs. Node Implementation

**NEEDS REVISION**

The Nano protocol is a complex piece of software aiming at a simple, singular goal: transfer value as efficiently as possible. Doing so on a network that is decentralized for the long-term involves many moving parts. Below are some detailed explanations of various pieces of the protocol intended for advanced developers and those with deep knowledge of the network.

## Problem statement and introducing a solution

## Expansion of the problem areas, previous attempts to solve them, and competing designs
